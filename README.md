# Speech Recognition
Base architecture for speech recognition neural network. The core of this architecture is provided by [Assembly AI](https://www.assemblyai.com/)

#### Additions:

* Visualizing the spectrogram and mel-spectrogram

#### Future work will include:

* Training experiments on various datasets (most likely different languages as well).

* Mozilla's Deep Speech project will also be explored/implemented in this repository.
